## Learning Support: eWallet Backend

Welcome to the **eWallet Backend** project! This repository provides a backend server designed specifically to support students learning iOS development. 

### Overview

This backend is not a fully-fledged eWallet application but rather a foundational setup to help students connect their iOS applications to a server. The primary goal is to give students a hands-on experience with backend integration, API interactions, and networking fundamentals.

### Key Features

- **Authentication**: JWT authentication mechanisms to help students understand user management and security.
- **Wallet**: see saldo on walet
- **Transaction**: create transaction request, pay, and update wallet
- **Topup**: using midtrans payment gateway

### Postman Collection

To help you test the API endpoints, a Postman collection is available. You can import this collection into Postman to get a pre-configured set of requests.

- **Postman Collection**: [eWallet Backend Postman Collection](postman/eWallet_Backend_Collection.json)

  - Download the Postman collection JSON file from the `postman` directory in this repository.
  - Open Postman and go to `File` -> `Import`.
  - Choose the downloaded JSON file to import the collection.
