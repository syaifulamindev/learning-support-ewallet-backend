## Learning Support: eWallet Backend

Welcome to the **eWallet Backend** project! This repository provides a backend server designed specifically to support students learning iOS development.

### Overview

This backend is not a fully-fledged eWallet application but rather a foundational setup to help students connect their iOS applications to a server. The primary goal is to give students a hands-on experience with backend integration, API interactions, and networking fundamentals.

### Key Features

- **Authentication**: JWT authentication mechanisms to help students understand user management and security.
- **Wallet**: View wallet balance.
- **Transaction**: Create transaction requests, process payments, and update wallet balances.
- **Topup**: Integrate with the Midtrans payment gateway for wallet top-ups.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/syaifulamindev/learning-support-ewallet-backend.git
   ```

2. **Install Tools**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.

   - Install Vapor (optional):
     ```sh
     brew install vapor
     ```

   - Install `qrencode` for generating QR codes (available on Linux as well):
     ```sh
     brew install qrencode
     ```

   - Install MongoDB:
     ```sh
     brew tap mongodb/brew
     brew install mongodb-community@7.0
     ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   - Start MongoDB as a background process. Please refer to the MongoDB documentation if this command does not work:
     ```sh
     mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf --fork
     ```

   - For the first run, execute the migration script:
     ```sh
     swift run App migrate
     ```

   - After that, you can run the server via Xcode (using the play button) or via the terminal:
     ```sh
     swift run
     ```

4. **Configure Payment Gateway**:
   We use Midtrans for top-ups.
   
   - Set up the Payment Notification URL by going to [Midtrans Dashboard](https://dashboard.sandbox.midtrans.com/settings/payment/notification) and changing the Payment Notification URL to `<base_url>/midtrans/notifications`.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following content:
     ```env
     SERVER_KEY='<your_server_key>'
     ```
     Get your server key from [Midtrans Dashboard](https://dashboard.sandbox.midtrans.com/settings/config_info).
     
### Postman Collection

To help you test the API endpoints, a Postman collection is available. You can import this collection into Postman to get a pre-configured set of requests.

- **Postman Collection**: [eWallet Backend Postman Collection](postman/eWallet_Backend_Collection.json)

  - Download the Postman collection JSON file from the `postman` directory in this repository.
  - Open Postman and go to `File` -> `Import`.
  - Choose the downloaded JSON file to import the collection.
